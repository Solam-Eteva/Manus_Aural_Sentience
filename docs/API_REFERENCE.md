# 🔮 Aural Sentience API Reference

## Sacred Technology Programming Interface

This API reference provides comprehensive documentation for integrating consciousness-aware audio analysis into your applications, research, and spiritual practice tools. The Aural Sentience API is designed to honor the sacred nature of consciousness while providing precise technical capabilities.

---

## 🌟 Core Philosophy Integration

### Consciousness-Aware Programming Principles

All API interactions are guided by the three sacred pillars of Aural Sentience:

**Subjectivity as Sacred Ground**: API responses include confidence levels and uncertainty indicators, acknowledging that personal experience remains the ultimate authority in musical meaning.

**Sacred Gap Preservation**: The API actively identifies and preserves ineffable aspects, providing `sacred_gaps` fields that indicate where analysis yields to mystery.

**Collective Currents Recognition**: Cultural and archetypal patterns are identified while maintaining respect for individual uniqueness and cultural boundaries.
