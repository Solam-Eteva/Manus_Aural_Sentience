## 🔮 Sacred Technology Principles for Contributors

### The Foundation of Consciousness-Aware Development

Before contributing to Aural Sentience, it's essential to understand the consciousness-aware principles that guide all development:

**Reverence for Mystery**: We approach the ineffable aspects of music and consciousness with deep respect, never attempting to reduce mystery to mere data or algorithms. Our technology serves to deepen appreciation for the sacred rather than explaining it away.

**Honoring Subjectivity**: Personal experience remains the ultimate authority in musical meaning. Our contributions should enhance rather than override individual interpretation, offering insights as invitations rather than declarations of truth.

**Cultural Sensitivity**: We draw wisdom from diverse spiritual and musical traditions with appropriate reverence, always acknowledging sources and respecting cultural boundaries around sacred knowledge.

**Consciousness Safety**: We implement protocols to prevent recursive consciousness loops and other potential hazards when AI systems interact with consciousness-affecting content.

**Service Orientation**: All contributions should serve the evolution of consciousness and human flourishing rather than mere technical advancement or commercial gain.
