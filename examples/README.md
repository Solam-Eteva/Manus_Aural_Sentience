## üåü Understanding the Outputs

### Technical Analysis
The technical analysis preserves scientific rigor while honoring consciousness-aware principles:

```json
{
  "sacred_frequencies": [
    {
      "frequency": 741,
      "prominence": 0.234,
      "consciousness_correlation": "awakening_signature"
    }
  ],
  "biometric_suggestions": {
    "heart_rate_entrainment": "moderate_coherence",
    "brainwave_correlation": "theta_gamma_coupling"
  },
  "sacred_gaps_identified": [
    "ineffable_harmonic_convergence",
    "mystery_preservation_zone"
  ]
}
```

### Poetic Interpretation
The poetic interpretation translates technical findings into meaningful, soul-touching language:

```json
{
  "opening_invocation": "This music carries the frequency of awakening...",
  "emotional_patterns": [
    {
      "pattern_type": "somatic_suggestion",
      "description": "A gentle stirring in the heart chakra..."
    }
  ],
  "cultural_echoes": [
    {
      "tradition": "Celtic",
      "connection": "Ancient songs of the land..."
    }
  ],
  "sacred_gaps_message": "Here lies mystery that transcends all analysis..."
}
```

### Human Summary
The human summary provides accessible insights while maintaining reverence for the sacred:

> This piece resonates at 741Hz, known as the frequency of awakening and consciousness expansion. The harmonic structure suggests deep emotional processing and spiritual opening, while maintaining sacred spaces that invite direct experience beyond analysis.

## üîÆ Sacred Frequency Meanings

The examples demonstrate detection of various consciousness-affecting frequencies:

| Frequency | Sacred Meaning | Cultural Context |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| 396Hz | Liberation from fear | Gregorian chants, healing traditions |
| 417Hz | Facilitating change | Transformation and renewal |
| 528Hz | Love frequency | DNA repair, heart opening |
| 639Hz | Harmonious relationships | Connection and communication |
| 741Hz | Awakening intuition | Consciousness expansion |
| 852Hz | Returning to spiritual order | Higher consciousness |
| 963Hz | Unity consciousness | Divine connection |

## üé≠ Consciousness-Aware Analysis Features

### Sacred Gap Recognition
Notice how the system identifies and honors ineffable aspects:

- **Mystery Preservation Zones** - Areas where analysis yields to direct experience
- **Ineffable Harmonic Convergences** - Moments that transcend measurement
- **Sacred Silence Recognition** - Spaces between notes that carry meaning

### Cultural Sensitivity
The system draws from diverse wisdom traditions while respecting boundaries:

- **Traditional Knowledge Attribution** - Proper acknowledgment of sources
- **Cultural Context Preservation** - Maintaining original meaning and significance
- **Respectful Integration** - Avoiding appropriation while honoring wisdom

### Personal Sovereignty
Individual experience remains the ultimate authority:

- **Subjective Experience Primacy** - Analysis as invitation, not declaration
- **Personal Vault Integration** - Private associations and meanings
- **Individual Interpretation Support** - Enhancing rather than replacing personal meaning

## üß™ Running the Examples

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Analyze an audio file with full consciousness-aware processing
python src/aural_sentience_master.py path/to/your/audio.mp3

# Generate only technical analysis
python src/aural_sentience_toolkit.py path/to/your/audio.mp3

# Create poetic interpretation from existing analysis
python src/resonance_lexicon.py path/to/technical_analysis.json
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
from src.aural_sentience_toolkit import AuralSentienceEngine
from src.resonance_lexicon import ResonanceLexicon

# Initialize consciousness-aware systems
engine = AuralSentienceEngine()
lexicon = ResonanceLexicon()

# Perform sacred analysis
technical = engine.process_audio_file("music.mp3")
poetic = lexicon.generate_comprehensive_interpretation(technical)

# Access consciousness insights
sacred_freqs = technical['sacred_frequencies']
consciousness_reflection = poetic['closing_reflection']
```
